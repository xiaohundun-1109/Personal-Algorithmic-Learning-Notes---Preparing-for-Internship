# Personal-Algorithmic-Learning-Notes---Preparing-for-Internship
https://how2j.cn/
Study 
1.	Where do you study? 
I study at SEU which is the SouthEast University. I am a junior student majoring in Computer Science. I moved away from my hometown to study here.
2.	Is it a good place to study? 
I think SEU is a brilliant place to study when talking about my area of study. Things like engineering, software development, and electronic information are brilliant subjects to study at SEU. Obviously, it is not the best place to study art or music. 
3.	Would you like the place where you study to make any changes? 
If I could I would like to make some changes to the place I study. The canteen here is really not to my taste. It would be nice if the canteen could add some pasta that is more suitable for northern tastes.


Where you live
1. How long have you lived in your area?
I have lived in this area for about three years now. I first moved here when I came to study at the university. I have been living in the dormitory of the university with the other students ever since I arrived. 
2. Do people of all ages live in your area? 
No, there is quite a specific age range to the people who live in my area. As I live in the dormitory of a university pretty much everyone who lives here is between the ages of 18 and 22. We are all studying our degrees and will move away once we have graduated. 
3. Is the area where you live a friendly place? 
Where I live is a very friendly place! We are all students so we have lots of common topics. We are all doing the same thing and all have to study hard, so we respect each other and get on well. We like to play games and go shopping to relax together.


Wild animals（新题） 
1. Are there many wild animals in your country? 
1） There is an abundance of wildlife in China! We have animals like the giant panda which are iconic of China. But there are also many other wild animals such as elephants, tigers, leopards and monkeys.
2） Yes, China has a rich biodiversity with a wide variety of wild animals, like the giant panda and golden monkey. But they are not very common in the areas that humans live. The only place we can see wild animals are the zoos in the city. 
2. Have you ever been to a zoo or safari park? 
1） Yes, I have been to many zoos and was even lucky enough to once visit a safari park with my parents. There is a zoo in my home city, and growing up I would visit often. Once, my parents took me to the Guangzhou Chimelong Safari Park as a reward for doing well in my exams. 
3. Have you seen any shows about wild animals recently? 
1）I am always on the look out for new wildlife documentaries and I watched one recently. A short while ago, I discovered David Attenborough’s collection of shows on wild animals. I watched one called ‘Frozen Planet’ which was about penguins and polar bears. 
2）I don’t really watch TV shows about wild animals, I think they are boring. Most nature documentaries are the same, they show predators and prey in their natural environments. It feels too much like a school lesson to me! 
4. What kind of animal would you like to see in the wild? 
我喜欢+动物的特点+ I saw a video on TikTok a couple years ago of dolphins leaping out of the water near some people on a boat. + It would be an amazing experience to watch some in the wild and see how they act in their natural environment. 

Rain（新题） 
1. How often does it rain where you live? 
1） I live in a very wet part of the country, and it rains all the time! Some parts of the world have wet seasons and dry seasons but where I live it seems to always be a wet season. 
2. Would you like to live somewhere very wet or very dry? 
1）If I had things my way I would live in a very dry place. Living in a wet place is so annoying and you always have to remember to carry an umbrella or wear a raincoat. I would like to live in a place that was dry. 
3. Have you ever changed your plans because it rained? 比较少，大多数时候我会带上雨伞不轻易改变计划，但当雨下的很大的时候我只能选择呆在室内
1）Yes, I frequently have to cancel my plans because it has started raining. Whenever I plan outdoor activities such as taking a nice walk or playing sports outside, it is always such a shame to cancel them because of the rain. There are some activities you just can’t enjoy in the rain. 
When it does, I do not let it spoil my plans. A little bit of rain never bothers me, so no matter what I have planned for the day, I will just put a coat on and go ahead with it. 
4. Do you enjoy going out in the rain? 不喜欢…
1）It is not fun to be wet and cold, so I do not like going out in the rain. When it is raining, I like to stay inside and wrap up warm. It is too much hassle to go out in the rain, I just wait for it to stop. 


Favourite day（新题） 
1. What's your favorite day of the week? 周五吧，因为是周末的开始
1）I think Saturday is the best day of the week, I look forward to it all throughout the working week. It is the first day of the weekend, so everyone is excited and energetic. 
2. What's your busiest day of the week? 周三？因为是工作日中靠中间的一天，进入了工作状态，任务也会比较多
I am exhausted by the end of a Thursday. 
3. If you could change what you do each week, what would it be? 同意！！
2） If I were to make a change to what I do each week I would give myself an extra day off in the middle of the week on Wednesday. I find it so hard to get through the working week and I feel like I do not have enough time to relax. 
4. Would you do the same thing on the same day every week? 
1）I would be quite happy to do the same thing on the same day every week. I like routines. I find it easier to follow set schedules and to know what to expect. So, I like having the same things to do on the same days. 


Day off（新题） 
1. When was the last time you had a day off from work or study? 
1）My last day off was just a few days ago at the weekend. I think it is very important to separate your work from your personal life. So, on the weekends I never do any work or any study. So, I get two days off from work or study every week. 
2. What do you usually like to do on your break? 
1）During my break I like to do relaxing and fun activities. I try to do things that are low effort such as watching comedy videos, listening to podcasts, or having light conversations with my friends. It is important to relax and switch off during your breaks. 
3. What would you do if you had a day off tomorrow? 幻想时刻？
1）That would be really nice!!!! 我要一觉睡到中午！If the weather was nice I would go on a long walk through the local park. And I would eat lots of good food! 
2）If I had the day off tomorrow I would catch up with all the chores I normally do at the weekend. I would do my laundry and tidy my house. 
4. Do you prefer to spend a day off with friends or family? 
2） When I have a day off I like to spend it with my family. I do not get a lot of time off and I miss spending time with my family very much. So any chance I get, I visit my family and spend the whole day with them


Health（新题） 
1. What's your favourite kind of exercise? 
2) My preferred way of staying in shape are gentle exercises such as jogging. I think exercise can be part of a normal lifestyle and your day to day activities. 
2. What do you usually do to keep healthy? 
2) To keep healthy I make sure I eat a balanced diet and I try to play a lot of sports with my friends. I avoid fatty foods and sugary drinks. I find this is enough to stay healthy. 
3. Did you learn about keeping fit at school? 
1) Yes, my school taught us about the importance of staying healthy and keeping fit. We had a lot of sports classes and also classes that taught us how to eat well and look after ourselves. School was about keeping our bodies strong as well as improving our minds. 
2) I didn’t really learn about keeping fit at school, rather my mother just raised me with healthy habits. At school we learned lessons like science, maths, and English. My mother taught me to eat well and encouraged me to stay active. 
4. How easy is it for people in your country to keep healthy? 
1) I would not say it is easy for people in my country to keep healthy, it takes a lot of discipline. There are so many fatty foods and treats that are full of sugar. Also, most people work sat at a computer all day. So, it takes a lot of effort and willpower to stay fit. 
There are so many sports centres, parks, and nice places to jog. It is easy to exercise in my country. Also, we have access to very good and nutritious food.
