# Personal-Algorithmic-Learning-Notes---Preparing-for-Internship
https://how2j.cn/
Study 
1.	Where do you study? 
I study at SEU which is the SouthEast University. I am a junior student majoring in Computer Science. I moved away from my hometown to study here.
2.	Is it a good place to study? 
I think SEU is a brilliant place to study when talking about my area of study. Things like engineering, software development, and electronic information are brilliant subjects to study at SEU. Obviously, it is not the best place to study art or music. 
3.	Would you like the place where you study to make any changes? 
If I could I would like to make some changes to the place I study. The canteen here is really not to my taste. It would be nice if the canteen could add some pasta that is more suitable for northern tastes.


Where you live
1. How long have you lived in your area?
I have lived in this area for about three years now. I first moved here when I came to study at the university. I have been living in the dormitory of the university with the other students ever since I arrived. 
2. Do people of all ages live in your area? 
No, there is quite a specific age range to the people who live in my area. As I live in the dormitory of a university pretty much everyone who lives here is between the ages of 18 and 22. We are all studying our degrees and will move away once we have graduated. 
3. Is the area where you live a friendly place? 
Where I live is a very friendly place! We are all students so we have lots of common topics. We are all doing the same thing and all have to study hard, so we respect each other and get on well. We like to play games and go shopping to relax together.


Wild animals（新题） 
1. Are there many wild animals in your country? 
1） There is an abundance of wildlife in China! We have animals like the giant panda which are iconic of China. But there are also many other wild animals such as elephants, tigers, leopards and monkeys.
2） Yes, China has a rich biodiversity with a wide variety of wild animals, like the giant panda and golden monkey. But they are not very common in the areas that humans live. The only place we can see wild animals are the zoos in the city. 
2. Have you ever been to a zoo or safari park? 
1） Yes, I have been to many zoos and was even lucky enough to once visit a safari park with my parents. There is a zoo in my home city, and growing up I would visit often. Once, my parents took me to the Guangzhou Chimelong Safari Park as a reward for doing well in my exams. 
3. Have you seen any shows about wild animals recently? 
1）I am always on the look out for new wildlife documentaries and I watched one recently. A short while ago, I discovered David Attenborough’s collection of shows on wild animals. I watched one called ‘Frozen Planet’ which was about penguins and polar bears. 
2）I don’t really watch TV shows about wild animals, I think they are boring. Most nature documentaries are the same, they show predators and prey in their natural environments. It feels too much like a school lesson to me! 
4. What kind of animal would you like to see in the wild? 
我喜欢+动物的特点+ I saw a video on TikTok a couple years ago of dolphins leaping out of the water near some people on a boat. + It would be an amazing experience to watch some in the wild and see how they act in their natural environment. 

Rain（新题） 
1. How often does it rain where you live? 
1） I live in a very wet part of the country, and it rains all the time! Some parts of the world have wet seasons and dry seasons but where I live it seems to always be a wet season. 
2. Would you like to live somewhere very wet or very dry? 
1）If I had things my way I would live in a very dry place. Living in a wet place is so annoying and you always have to remember to carry an umbrella or wear a raincoat. I would like to live in a place that was dry. 
3. Have you ever changed your plans because it rained? 比较少，大多数时候我会带上雨伞不轻易改变计划，但当雨下的很大的时候我只能选择呆在室内
1）Yes, I frequently have to cancel my plans because it has started raining. Whenever I plan outdoor activities such as taking a nice walk or playing sports outside, it is always such a shame to cancel them because of the rain. There are some activities you just can’t enjoy in the rain. 
When it does, I do not let it spoil my plans. A little bit of rain never bothers me, so no matter what I have planned for the day, I will just put a coat on and go ahead with it. 
4. Do you enjoy going out in the rain? 不喜欢…
1）It is not fun to be wet and cold, so I do not like going out in the rain. When it is raining, I like to stay inside and wrap up warm. It is too much hassle to go out in the rain, I just wait for it to stop. 


Favourite day（新题） 
1. What's your favorite day of the week? 周五吧，因为是周末的开始
1）I think Saturday is the best day of the week, I look forward to it all throughout the working week. It is the first day of the weekend, so everyone is excited and energetic. 
2. What's your busiest day of the week? 周三？因为是工作日中靠中间的一天，进入了工作状态，任务也会比较多
I am exhausted by the end of a Thursday. 
3. If you could change what you do each week, what would it be? 同意！！
2） If I were to make a change to what I do each week I would give myself an extra day off in the middle of the week on Wednesday. I find it so hard to get through the working week and I feel like I do not have enough time to relax. 
4. Would you do the same thing on the same day every week? 
1）I would be quite happy to do the same thing on the same day every week. I like routines. I find it easier to follow set schedules and to know what to expect. So, I like having the same things to do on the same days. 


Day off（新题） 
1. When was the last time you had a day off from work or study? 
1）My last day off was just a few days ago at the weekend. I think it is very important to separate your work from your personal life. So, on the weekends I never do any work or any study. So, I get two days off from work or study every week. 
2. What do you usually like to do on your break? 
1）During my break I like to do relaxing and fun activities. I try to do things that are low effort such as watching comedy videos, listening to podcasts, or having light conversations with my friends. It is important to relax and switch off during your breaks. 
3. What would you do if you had a day off tomorrow? 幻想时刻？
1）That would be really nice!!!! 我要一觉睡到中午！If the weather was nice I would go on a long walk through the local park. And I would eat lots of good food! 
2）If I had the day off tomorrow I would catch up with all the chores I normally do at the weekend. I would do my laundry and tidy my house. 
4. Do you prefer to spend a day off with friends or family? 
2） When I have a day off I like to spend it with my family. I do not get a lot of time off and I miss spending time with my family very much. So any chance I get, I visit my family and spend the whole day with them


Health（新题） 
1. What's your favourite kind of exercise? 
2) My preferred way of staying in shape are gentle exercises such as jogging. I think exercise can be part of a normal lifestyle and your day to day activities. 
2. What do you usually do to keep healthy? 
2) To keep healthy I make sure I eat a balanced diet and I try to play a lot of sports with my friends. I avoid fatty foods and sugary drinks. I find this is enough to stay healthy. 
3. Did you learn about keeping fit at school? 
1) Yes, my school taught us about the importance of staying healthy and keeping fit. We had a lot of sports classes and also classes that taught us how to eat well and look after ourselves. School was about keeping our bodies strong as well as improving our minds. 
2) I didn’t really learn about keeping fit at school, rather my mother just raised me with healthy habits. At school we learned lessons like science, maths, and English. My mother taught me to eat well and encouraged me to stay active. 
4. How easy is it for people in your country to keep healthy? 
1) I would not say it is easy for people in my country to keep healthy, it takes a lot of discipline. There are so many fatty foods and treats that are full of sugar. Also, most people work sat at a computer all day. So, it takes a lot of effort and willpower to stay fit. 
There are so many sports centres, parks, and nice places to jog. It is easy to exercise in my country. Also, we have access to very good and nutritious food.

二、	实习环节中遇到的问题及困难
实习中遇到的问题可以总结为以下几个方面：
第一，学校生活向公司环境转变的不适应。在学校时，学习和生活相对自由，时间也比较充裕，可以自主安排。然而，进入公司后，一切都变得井然有序，需要严格遵守公司的规章制度和作息时间。公司的工作氛围、企业文化和人际关系都与学校截然不同。在公司，我需要更加注重团队合作和沟通，共同完成任务。这种环境上的转变让我在开始阶段感到有些不适应，需要我花费一定的时间和精力去适应和学习。
第二，工作过程中遇到的开发问题。作为实习生，我参与到了公司的实际业务开发中。然而，由于经验的缺乏，我在开发过程中遇到了不少技术难题。比如，对某些python库的使用不熟练，导致开发效率不高；对项目的整体架构理解不够深入，导致在修改代码时经常出错。此外，我还发现实际项目中的需求往往比学校中的课程项目更加复杂多变，需要综合运用多种知识和技能。这些问题都需要我不断学习和实践，通过查阅文档、请教同事，逐渐克服技术上的难题，提高自己的开发能力。
第三，理论知识与实际应用的过渡。学校的课程往往更加注重理论知识和基础技能的培养，而实习则要求我们将这些知识应用到实际工作中。在学校时，我们学习了很多理论知识，包括编程语言、数据结构和算法等。然而，实际项目中的需求更加复杂多变，需要综合运用多种知识和技能。比如，在开发中我需要考虑到性能优化、代码可读性、可维护性等多个方面，而这些在学校中往往并没有涉及到。因此，我在实习过程中需要不断学习和探索，将理论知识与实际应用相结合。
三、	具体解决方案
具体的开发任务中，起初，面对站点配置下多个测试组件的开发任务，我体会到了报文格式的不确定性所带来困难。不同按钮和开关的选择会直接影响报文的元素和数据类型，这要求我要多次观察报文格式并尝试下发，以确保每种组合下的报文格式准确无误。同时，用户输入参数也十分复杂，于是我对一些不合规的数据手动判断并抛错，以免到之后的计算产生一些不必要的问题。
进入第二周，随着云管理开局特殊组件的完善工作展开，我遇到了代码规范不统一和输入格式的问题。我采纳导师的建议，对代码进行细致的修改和优化。此外，我还发现了报文数据格式需要手动转换为json才能正常下发的难题，通过不断调试和验证，最终解决了这一问题。
第三周，新的GND业务相关测试工具开发任务带来了新的挑战。由于模块之间存在复杂的嵌套关系，获取全部参数的工作量显著增加，且小组内出现了开发工作的重复。面对这一困境，我们积极寻求导师的帮助，并通过团队讨论探索解决方案。虽然过程中遇到了一些波折，但最终还是顺利推进了开发进度。
第四周，在继续上周任务的同时，我认领了一个新页面的组件开发任务。这次，我遇到了定位问题以及如何将获取到的参数进行有效组合和验证的难题。通过参考相关代码和不断试错，我成功解决了定位问题，【具体定位方式】并学会了使用python的内置函数来实现参数的组合。


四、自己的体会
回顾这几周的实习经历，实习过程中遇到的问题和困难是多方面的，包括环境适应、技术难题和理论知识与实际应用的过渡等。然而，正是这些问题和困难让我更加深入地了解了自己的不足和需要提高的地方。通过不断学习和实践，我逐渐克服了这些困难，也提升了自己的专业素养和实践能力。这次实习经历让我更加明确了自己的职业发展方向和目标，也为我未来的职业生涯奠定了坚实的基础。我相信在未来的工作中，我会继续遇到各种挑战和困难，但我也会以更加积极的态度去面对它们，不断学习和成长。
