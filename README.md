Study 
1.	Where do you study? 
I study at SEU which is the SouthEast University. I am a junior student majoring in Computer Science. I moved away from my hometown to study here.
2.	Is it a good place to study? 
I think SEU is a brilliant place to study when talking about my area of study. Things like engineering, software development, and electronic information are brilliant subjects to study at SEU. Obviously, it is not the best place to study art or music. 
3.	Would you like the place where you study to make any changes? 
If I could I would like to make some changes to the place I study. The canteen here is really not to my taste. It would be nice if the canteen could add some pasta that is more suitable for northern tastes.


Where you live
1. How long have you lived in your area?
I have lived in this area for about three years now. I first moved here when I came to study at the university. I have been living in the dormitory of the university with the other students ever since I arrived. 
2. Do people of all ages live in your area? 
No, there is quite a specific age range to the people who live in my area. As I live in the dormitory of a university pretty much everyone who lives here is between the ages of 18 and 22. We are all studying our degrees and will move away once we have graduated. 
3. Is the area where you live a friendly place? 
Where I live is a very friendly place! We are all students so we have lots of common topics. We are all doing the same thing and all have to study hard, so we respect each other and get on well. We like to play games and go shopping to relax together.


Wild animals（新题） 
1. Are there many wild animals in your country? 
1） There is an abundance of wildlife in China! We have animals like the giant panda which are iconic of China. But there are also many other wild animals such as elephants, tigers, leopards and monkeys.
2） Yes, China has a rich biodiversity with a wide variety of wild animals, like the giant panda and golden monkey. But they are not very common in the areas that humans live. The only place we can see wild animals are the zoos in the city. 
2. Have you ever been to a zoo or safari park? 
1） Yes, I have been to many zoos and was even lucky enough to once visit a safari park with my parents. There is a zoo in my home city, and growing up I would visit often. Once, my parents took me to the Guangzhou Chimelong Safari Park as a reward for doing well in my exams. 
2） I have never visited a zoo or safari park because I don’t really like them. I find it sad to see animals kept in cages, and fenced into small areas. I know it isn’t all bad, but I would rather see animals in the wild than kept in a zoo. 3. Have you seen any shows about wild animals recently? 1）I am always on the look out for new wildlife documentaries and I watched one recently. A short while ago, I discovered David Attenborough’s collection of shows on wild animals. I watched one called ‘Frozen Planet’ which was about penguins and polar bears. 2）I don’t really watch TV shows about wild animals, I think they are boring. Most nature documentaries are the same, they show predators and prey in their natural environments. It feels too much like a school lesson to me! 4. What kind of animal would you like to see in the wild? 1） My favourite animal is the giraffe and it is my dream to see one on the wild! I think giraffes are such fascinating and unusual creatures. It would be an amazing experience to watch some in the wild and see how they act in their natural environment. 2） I have always wanted to see wild dolphins. I saw a video on TikTok a couple years ago of dolphins leaping out of the water near some people on a boat. It looked incredible! I would like to see that for myself one day.
